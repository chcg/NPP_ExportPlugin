Notes
------------

Scintilla uses the default style to determine the tabstops (every tabsize spaces)
These tabstops are used for every style, so tabs may not match the use of spaces,
especially on non-proportional fonts (and using UTF8 makes things even worse, 
although it should have no effect on indents).
HTML makes it very hard to mimick this behaviour, so tabs may not always
align your text as they do in Scintilla. For best results just use the same font
for all styles, its usually the colors that make most of the difference anyway ;).
